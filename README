=== An implementation of Conway's Game of Life, done in very basic C+++
The rules used are the (fairly standard) ones outlined at the beginning 
	of this Wikipedia article:
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

Included in this project are some sample files located in the "samples"
	directory. They are all ASCII text files, but there are two formats:
	
The first format, which I will call a coordinate file, is a list of 
	coordinates, one pair per line, each number separated by space, each
	coordinate pair separated by a newline.
The second format, which I call a pictorial file, is a simple depiction 
	of the initial state, with a '.' meaning a dead cell, and anything 
	else being alive. This was used so as to easily use the depictions 
	found here: http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex.htm

To compile this project, simply type "make." This will result in two
	executables "life-gui" and "life-cmd". 
	
To run the GUI, either type "./life-gui" or for graphical opening, use
	the "GoL.sh" script. Click-to-run should working using the script.
	The rest should be self-explanatory. Below are instructions for the command 
	line version:

Usage: ./life-cmd [-w WIDTH] [-h HEIGHT] [-t TURNS] [-x] [-y] [-c] [-e] [-f FILENAME]

(Ordering does not matter. All of these options except FILENAME can be 
omitted without any errors, as they have default values. No guarantee 
how nice it will look though)

	[-w WIDTH] sets the width. If omitted, pictorial board will attempt to
		detect width automatically. Coordinate boards will default to 20.

	[-h HEIGHT] sets the height. If omitted, pictorial board will attempt to
		detect width automatically. Coordinate boards will default to 20.
	
	[-t TURNS] sets the number of turns to run for. If omitted, will 
		default to 100.

	IMPORTANT: All above options must be positive integers. Results in 
		exit and error otherwise.

	[-x] Deactivates horizontal wrapping in computation of cell status for 
		next turn.

	[-y] Deactivates vertical wrapping in computation of cell status for 
		next turn.

	[-c] Activates coordinate file intake instead of pictorial.

	[-e] Activates expanded printing mode for display of the board. Will
		display a count of the population for each turn.
